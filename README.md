## My process
I used my phone to code.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

- SPCK for mobile is what i use to code.

### What I learned


I learnt how to hover a background image.
I learnt how to just make things work, its quite harder though, but then I always love to try.



### Continued development
I hope to improve on this skill, although coding with my phone is a bit difficult.



### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me for styling my css. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is an amazing website which helped me finally understand media query. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
